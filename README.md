# Online Digital Shop

It's a pet-project to showcase my general skills in a web development.

This project is about my capability of developing modern e-commerce projects.

The project will be polished over time and will be receiving new updates as long as I get new valuable and profound skills.

If you're just looking for practice, feel free to copy and modify this code in any way.
